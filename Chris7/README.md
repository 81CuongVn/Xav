- Add ghost ping detector

It's added as a Cog, so it's easy to integrate into the main file (1 line).

Based on the the functionality found in the [CodeSupport bot](https://github.com/codesupport/discord-bot), but translated from TypeScript to Python and improved, for example made it not detect deleted messages which mention/reply only to bots and slightly improved the look of the message about a reply deletion.

- Make commands case insensitive
